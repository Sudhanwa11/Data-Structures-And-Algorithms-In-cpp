this code aims to find the middle node of a singly linked list. Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. getLength Function:

This function calculates the length (number of nodes) of the linked list.
It starts with a counter variable length initialized to 0.
Then, it enters a while loop that iterates through the linked list until it reaches the end (i.e., head becomes NULL).
In each iteration of the loop, it increments the length counter by 1 and moves the head pointer to the next node in the list.
Finally, it returns the total length of the linked list.

2. findMiddle Function:

This function uses the getLength function to calculate the length of the linked list.
It divides the length by 2 to find the position of the middle node and stores it in the ans variable.
It initializes a pointer temp to the head of the linked list.
It also initializes a counter variable count to 0.

3. Middle Node Calculation:

The while loop is used to traverse the linked list until the count reaches ans, which is the middle position.
In each iteration, it moves the temp pointer to the next node in the list and increments the count by 1.
When the count becomes equal to ans, the temp pointer will be pointing to the middle node of the linked list.

4. Finally, the function returns the temp pointer, which points to the middle node of the linked list.
