Sample Input :
N2 i&nJA?a& jnI2n

A1b22Ba

Sample Output :
Yes

No

Explanation 1 :


For the first test case, S = “N2 i&nJA?a& jnI2n”. If we ignore the special characters, whitespaces and convert all uppercase letters to lowercase, we get S = “n2injaajni2n”, which is a palindrome. Hence, the given string is also a palindrome.


For the second test case, S = “A1b22Ba”. If we ignore the special characters, whitespaces and convert all uppercase letters to lowercase, we get S = “a1b22ba”, which is not a palindrome. Hence, the given string is not a palindrome.
